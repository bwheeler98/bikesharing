# Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to use Tableau to create appealing visualizations that illustrate the analysis of the data.  Tableau makes it easier to create these important visualizations.  The dataset was large, so there were multiple questions we could answer via Tableau worksheets.  The observations that were analyzed were: Checkout Times for Users, Checkout Times by Gender, Trips by Weekday by Each Hour, Trips by Gender by Weekday per Hour, and User Trips by Gender by Weekday.

## Results

## Summary

This analysis provides investors with a lot of important information that is easily understood via visualizations.  Investors can see many different insights based on this data and the visualizations.  We provided visualizations for Checkout Times by Users, Checkout Time by Gender, Trips by Weeekday by Each Hour, Trips by Gender by Weekday per Hour, Trips by User Type by Weekday per Gender, Average Trip Duration Based on Age, and finally the Top Starting Locations.  All of these visualizations provide insight that is valuable to the company's operation and marketing strategies.  There are other questions that can be answered about this data via Tableau visualizations.  An additional visualization that can be helpful is the starting location based on gender as well as the ending location based on gender.  These visualizations can provide key marketing strategies.  Another useful visualization would be to show the paths/trips of each bike ID in order to get a better idea of the average bike's usage rate.  This would provide insight for the company's operations.
